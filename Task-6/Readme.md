## <span style="color: #FD1C03 "> **Motivation**

<br>
    
> * Customize your car in a number of ways and audio/video, paint, wheels, performance, suspension, and window tinting are the ones that will make the biggest impact.<br>
> * A standard product or market vision isn’t just insufficient; it simply doesn’t make sense.<br>
> * In a true mass-customization environment, no one knows exactly what the next customer will want, leaders of continuous-improvement companies and mass customizers foster very different approaches to the future.<br> 
> * A normal car can't fulfill the dreams of the customer so we help them to upgrade as per their wish and provide their dream model in real life.

### <span style="color: #16F529 "> **What does it mean to customize a car?**
<br>
    
* A custom car is a passenger vehicle that has been either substantially altered to improve its performance, often by altering or replacing the engine and transmission; made into a personal "styling" statement, using paint work and aftermarket accessories to make the car look unlike any car as delivered from the factory
<br>

### <span style="color: #16F529 "> **Why you should customize your car?**
<br>
    
*  One of the biggest and more appealing reasons people customize their vehicle is to give their vehicles a boost in appearance.<br>
* This is an easy way to do it.<br>
* The results will make your vehicle look much cooler and aesthetically pleasing.

## <span style="color:  #FD1C03"> **Future Improvement:**
<br>

> * We will customize their vehicle as they imagine or they can also provide the design.<br>
> * We are planning to shifting to a software-driven model,so that we can regularly issue ongoing software updates over time to improve existing functionality and quickly add new features to the hardware framework.<br>
> * These cars are projected to use GPS systems to detect an object through the windshields.<br> 
> * Augmented reality cars relay information on the windscreens then give suggestions to the driver.
